# React JSONPlaceholder App

This project utilizes React to create a user interface that fetches data from two endpoints `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1` and `https://jsonplaceholder.
typicode.com/photos` user informationand photo data. The `App` component orchestrates the fetching of user and photo data and store using `useEffect` and `useState` hooks. The `UserInfo` component displays detailed user information including name, username,
email, address, phone, website, and company details. The `PhotoGrid` component presents a grid of photos fetched from the API, each accompanied by its title. This project demonstrates 
the integration of React with external APIs to dynamically render user and photo data.
